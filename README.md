# Tic Tac Toe
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe! Here's how to play:
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty cell.
3. To make a move, enter the number corresponding to the cell (1-9).
4. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
5. If all 9 cells are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw.
Let's start the game!
